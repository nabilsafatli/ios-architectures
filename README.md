# iOS Architectures

This repository contains use cases of Architectures in Swift and Objective C.


## Swift

### Role Playing Game
To play around with MVVM and RXSwift [this project](https://github.com/nabilsafatli/ios-architectures/tree/master/swift/RolePlayingGame) will hold my ideas about how to scale an application using this architecture.


## Objective-C

### Architectures
This is a very simple project where I still want to get back and experiment some ideas with Objective-C in different architecture styles.
